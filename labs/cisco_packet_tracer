Tools Used

For the hands-on labs in this repo, I've primarily used Cisco Packet Tracer.
Additionally, here are some other tools that can complement your learning:

GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator) – Great for more complex network simulations.

EVE-NG (Emulated Virtual Environment) – Another option for advanced network setups.

Wireshark – Perfect for network traffic analysis and capturing packets.

Vagrant – Used for automating the creation and management of virtual machines.

Feel free to explore and experiment with these tools as they can help deepen your understanding of networking concepts!
